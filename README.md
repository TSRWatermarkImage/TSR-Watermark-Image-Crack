## Features of TSR-Watermark-Image

The project comes with several features designed to streamline the watermarking process, including:

### 1. **Support for Text and Image Watermarks**
   - You can add a custom text or logo as your watermark. This flexibility is essential for different use cases â€“ from personal branding to company logos.
   
### 2. **Position Customization**
   - You have complete control over where the watermark is placed on the image. Whether it's in the center, bottom-right, or top-left, you can position your watermark wherever suits your needs best.
   
### 3. **Opacity Adjustment**
   - Adjust the transparency of your watermark to ensure it doesn't overpower your image. This ensures your watermark is noticeable but doesn't obscure important details of the image.

### 4. **Font & Size Customization**
   - If you choose to add text as your watermark, you can easily customize the font style and size to match your personal or brandâ€™s aesthetic.
   
### 5. **Batch Watermarking**
   - TSR-Watermark-Image supports batch watermarking, allowing you to watermark multiple images at once. This feature can save you a significant amount of time when working with large collections of images.

## How to Get Started with TSR-Watermark-Image

Using **TSR-Watermark-Image** is simple and requires a few steps. Here's how to get started:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, youâ€™ll need to clone the project from GitHub to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TSR-Watermark-Image.git
```

Once cloned, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd TSR-Watermark-Image
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

The project uses Python, so you'll need to ensure you have Python installed. You also need to install the required dependencies using pip. Typically, you can do this with the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Run the Script

After installation, you can run the script using Python. The basic syntax to add a watermark is:

```bash
python watermark.py --input /path/to/your/image.jpg --output /path/to/output/image.jpg --watermark-text "Your Watermark" --position "bottom-right" --opacity 0.5
```

- **--input**: Path to the input image file.
- **--output**: Path where the watermarked image will be saved.
- **--watermark-text**: The text you want to appear as the watermark.
- **--position**: Position of the watermark (e.g., bottom-right, center, etc.).
- **--opacity**: How transparent the watermark will be.

### Step 4: Customize Your Watermark

You can also change the font, size, and other properties of the watermark by adding additional parameters or modifying the script itself. For instance, you can modify the watermark to add an image logo instead of text, or tweak other settings such as the watermarkâ€™s angle or padding.

### Step 5: Batch Watermarking

To watermark multiple images, you can specify a directory and use batch processing. This is particularly helpful for watermarking an entire set of images at once.

```bash
python watermark.py --input /path/to/images/ --output /path/to/output/ --watermark-text "Brand Watermark" --batch
```
